    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and the moon was <b>full!</b></p>
    <p>In the distance, a wolf <i>howled...</i></p>
    <p>and a fat little goblin hobbled behind a tree.</p>
    <p>The witches were singing "Double--double--toil and trouble--"</p>
    <p>"AAA!" the goblin shrieked.</p>
    <p>The witches were startled and fell off their chairs!!!!</p>
